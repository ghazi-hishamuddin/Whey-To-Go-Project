# ðŸ’ª Whey-To-Go Project

In this project, I dove into the exciting world of SQL database design and development, alongside crafting custom SQL queries and bringing data to life through an interactive dashboard using a BI tool. It's important to note that the data used in this project is entirely fictional, crafted to simulate real-world scenarios. My main goal throughout this journey was to fully immerse myself in every aspect of the project, from understanding the client's needs to delivering a dynamic dashboard solution. By taking on this project, I aimed to not only expand my skills but also gain practical experience in handling end-to-end projects with confidence.
