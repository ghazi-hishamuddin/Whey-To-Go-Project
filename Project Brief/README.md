## Project Scenario

Client: Wei Xuan </br>
Business: Online Protein Smoothie Store

## Project Brief
Wei Xuan, the founder of a successful protein smoothie business on Instagram, seeks to transition towards a data-centric approach. Recognizing the limitations of manual processes, she aims to leverage data analytics and management to enhance efficiency and drive growth.

## Objective
The project involves two main tasks:
+ Design and build a custom relational database to capture all essential information and data generated by the business. 
+ This database will enable Wei Xuan to monitor business performance through dashboards.
  

## Target Areas
There are two main areas the client brief requires us to concentrate on: 
+ Customer Orders
+ Inventory Control </br>

<h2> 1. Customer Orders: </h2>

We need to determine the different data needed to track customer orders. This is a sample mockup of the customer orders table:

I will including a row_id as a primary key to ensure that each row in the table has a unique identifier, as order_id may be duplicated. This allows for easier management and referencing of specific orders.
This how it will look like when populated:

This is datatypes proposed in the schema design:

     height="400" />


To optimize efficiency and reduce redundancy in the order data, I propose a normalization approach by introducing identifiers for both customer names and their addresses. This streamlined schema design aims to enhance data management and retrieval. Here's the drafted schema:

     height="400" />

This will serve two main purposes: Reduce the amount of data in the orders table and provides an efficient and futureproof database if my client needs to ever make changes to the name of an item.
